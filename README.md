## Metrics

### Bundle Size

The size of the bundles after the build.

- `minified-bundle-size`: the compressed size of bundles.
- `gzipped-bundle-size`: the size of bundles after compression & gzip.

### Compile Speed

- `dev-plugin-setup-time`: the time it takes from the start of the dev command to the completion of loading all plugins. Corresponding hooks: `loadConfig -> loadPlugin`.
- `dev-prepare-time`: the time taken from the time the plugins are loaded to the time when the build prep process is fully completed. Corresponding hooks: `loadPlugin -> prepare`.
- `dev-cold-boot-time`: the time it takes for the dev build to complete without caching. Corresponding hooks: `beforeDev -> afterDev`.
- `dev-hot-boot-time`: the time taken to complete the dev build with cache. Corresponding hooks: `beforeDev -> afterDev`.
- `build-plugin-setup-time`: the time taken from the start of the build command until all plugins have been loaded. Corresponding hooks: `loadConfig -> loadPlugin`.
- `build-prepare-time`: the time taken from when the plugins are loaded to when the build prep process is fully completed. Corresponding hooks: `loadPlugin -> prepare`.
- `build-cold-boot-time`: the time it takes for the build to complete without caching. Corresponding hooks: `beforeBuild -> afterBuild`.
- `build-hot-boot-time`: the time it takes to complete a build with caching. Corresponding hooks: `beforeBuild -> afterBuild`.

### Install Speed

Install npm dependency related metrics.

- `yarn-install-size`: the size of node_modules after yarn install .
- `yarn-cold-install-time`: yarn install time, with cache and lock file.
- `yarn-hot-install-time`: yarn install time, without cache and lock file.
- `yarn-dependencies-count`: the total number of dependencies after yarn install.
